## Introduction

### What is SQL? 
SQL is a method for communicating between you and the database. SQL is used to query, insert, update, and modify data. Many of the commands used in SQL are easy to interpret as compared to many other computer languages. SQL, as a language, is straightforward to understand and learn. 


### Why is it essential to learn SQL
None of us are too surprised by the fact that data is everywhere. If we are aware of it or not, information is being collected and stored from all of us. Everything is getting saved as data, from what we buy at the store, the movies, and music we prefer, our internet searches, our food preferences, and so much more. Plenty of data is also collected for research and development, academia, medical science, and technological advances. Understanding SQL is fundamental to successful data analytics, so let's jump into it and learn all about it. 


### Our learning goals and prerequisites
The purpose of this learning content is to give you a primer in the fundamentals of SQL and work with data to begin analyzing it for data science purposes.

The content is divided into modules, and we will start with simple queries and build on them. For this learning material, we will use a public data set freely available on

The link has details about the data set and the schema. It is suggested that you go through the dataset and familiarize yourself with the data before proceeding to the next steps. **We'll be posting the next steps one after another**.

**Stay tuned!**
