  "description": "Digits 0 and 1, have a numerical significance on our lives. The numbers having 0 are valued when the zeros are to the right rather than to the left. E.g: number 100 is valued than number 001. But in smart digital devices, it has logical significance. The digits 1 and 0 are valued as high and low numbers. While these digits are valued as the output, the decision making element is called the Logic Gates.",
