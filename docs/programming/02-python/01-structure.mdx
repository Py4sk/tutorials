## Comment

Comments allow you to describe the code or the logic written for the program. You can have single or multiple lines of comments. To comment in Python, use **#**:

```python
# This is a comment
```

A multi line comment can be declared using **“““ “““**

```python
"""
First line
Second line
third line
...
...
...
"""
```

## Python shell

Similar to Unix shell, Python has a shell prompt **>>>**. The prompt takes input and shows the output in the next line.

```python
>>>
```

Here's an example of adding variables using the prompt:

```python
>>> x = 4 + 1
>>> y = 2 + 1
>>> z = x + y
>>> z
8
```

## File extension

The extension of a python script file is **.py**

Here's the same addition program inside a python script file:

```python
x = 4 + 1
y = 2 + 1
z = x + y

print(z)
```

To run this python script in a Unix shell:

```sh
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ python addition.py
user@theprogrammingfoundation:~$ 8
```
